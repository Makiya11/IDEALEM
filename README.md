# IDEALEM
This is an implementation of the data compression method IDEALEM. IDEALEM stands for Implementation of Dynamic Extensible Adaptive Locally Exchangeable Measures.

This data compression is a combination of lossy and lossless compression. It utilizes the data reduction and pattern searching algorithm for streaming data based on Locally Exchangeable Measures.

This method allow to compress 1GB binary file by a factor of 250
